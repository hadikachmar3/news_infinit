The application is organized into the following directories:

- `lib/`: Main directory for Dart source files.
  - `constants/`: Contains all the constant values used throughout the app.
  - `models/`: Data models that represent the structure of the objects used in the app.
  - `provider/`: State management files using the Provider package.
  - `screens/`: Screen widgets that represent each page of the app.
  - `services/`: Services for handling functions that are used in the whole app, in wide cases this can be extended to be used to cover methods connected to the backend
  - `widgets/`: Custom reusable widget components.
  - `main.dart`: The entry point of the application.


## State Management

This app uses the [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package for state management.

Each major feature has its own `Provider` that encapsulates its state and business logic, ensuring a separation of concerns and easier maintainability.

## Download and Test the App

To test the app, pre-built Android APKs are available for download. You can find them in the repository under the following link:

[Android APKs for Testing](https://github.com/hadikachmar3/news_infinit/tree/master/Android%20APKs)

Simply download the appropriate APK file to your Android device and install it to begin testing.

## Usage
